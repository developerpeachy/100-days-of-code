# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 4 2020

##### Project: rosalie.dev

**Today's Progress**: Scrapped redundant code, re-build CSS.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with this rebuild in terms with, package versions and updating other packages and removing libraries that no longer serve the purpose. I have succeeded in making a successful build that was suitable for tomorrow's work. (1.5hr)

### Day 1: April 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added styled-components, fonts and redesigned the app using Figma.

**Thoughts**: Adding fonts was a bitch, but we got there. I used Styled components, and utilised ThemeConsumer and GlobalStyles properties to append styles/fonts to the NextJS app. Pushed these changes to master to reflect them in production.

### Day 2: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added the dark/light mode toggle using React Hooks and styled-components.

**Thoughts**: This was challenging to add with NextJS. To change the theme colors, I discovered that we had to append the theme colour scheme to the ThemeProvider which was in \_app.js. This worked successfully when adding in Header component inside \_app.js. I soon realised that this was not a sustainable idea and I discovered a bug when you refresh or first land on the website. I have an idea on how to fix this and will look at the issue closely tomorrow.

### Day 3: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dark/Light mode bug: on refresh.

**Thoughts**: I didn't write any code, but I have been doing more research into how NextJS handles state and I have an idea on how to fix this bug. I'd say today was not a code day, but rather a background research day. I had passover tonight and I couldn't code/work on this after dark.

### Day 4: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100DaysOfCode repo and added my log notes, cleaned up code on website.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't write as much code as I wanted to tonight, because my family are doing some Easter things. I had instead, forked the 100 Days of Code repo and entered my logs for the past few days. I have also cleaned up the code on my website, but nothing much to commit here! Happy Passover! :heart:
